Data and Supporting Files Included in This Repository*

1. Core Algorithm Notebook
   The primary workflow for the protein clustering approach is implemented in the Jupyter notebook 36_primary.ipynb. This notebook shows the entire sequence of data loading, preprocessing, feature construction, clustering, and evaluation steps used in the study.

2. Supplementary Excel Files
   Several Excel files used during the development and evaluation of the algorithm are included in the repository. These files contain:

    Input datasets used for generating binary representations of protein sequences.
    Intermediate data tables created during preprocessing and feature extraction.
   Supporting reference files required for validating the clustering output.

3. Role of the Excel Files in the Workflow
   The Excel files play a central role in reproducing the results. They provide:

   The raw or partially processed data that serve as inputs to 36_primary.ipynb.
   Metadata and supporting information for mapping protein identifiers to computed descriptors.
   Additional matrices or lookup tables needed for generating the Minimal Moment Vector (MiniVec) and other derived features.

4. Reproducibility and Transparency
   All datasets and supporting materials are organized within the repository so that other researchers can reproduce the experimental pipeline end to end. The structure allows users to run the notebook directly without requiring external dependencies beyond those listed in the environment configuration.

5. Ongoing Additions
   As the work progresses, additional Excel files and helper utilities are added. These files are placed in clearly labeled folders to maintain clarity and easy navigation.
